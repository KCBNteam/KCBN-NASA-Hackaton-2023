We developed our website using OutSystems, a low-code development platform. If you would like to review the source code, please note that it is only accessible on the OutSystems platform. To do this, you will need to be in the OutSystems environment.

<h2>1 - ACCESSING AND REVIEWING THE SOURCE CODE IN OUTSYSTEMS</h2>

You can access and review our project by following these steps:
- Launch the OutSystems Service Studio, which is the integrated development environment (IDE) provided by OutSystems.
- Sign in or create a free OutSystems account if prompted.
- Once you are in OutSystems Service Studio, you can import KCBN.oap and KCBN_Base.oap into the application and explore the project by opening the project files or using the provided project file.


Note that here you'll have access to the full source code, where you can review and assess our project within the OutSystems environment.


Thank you for your interest in our project, and we appreciate your time and effort in evaluating it within the OutSystems environment.
